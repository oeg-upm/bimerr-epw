# Mappings

The mappings found in the epw folder have been written using the [RML language](https://rml.io/specs/rml/).

The mappings found in the openweathermap folder have been written using the [JSON language](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) with a specific nomenclature called Helio, belonging to a system also called [Helio](https://oeg-upm.github.io/helio/).

It should be noted that all the mappings described above are declarative.
